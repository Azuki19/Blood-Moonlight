Game Overview

Blood Moonlight is a **vampire-themed board game** where the most powerful clans in the world of darkness compete in an **ancient ritual** to claim the throne of the night. Each clan sends its most agile, cunning, and lethal vampire to the cursed town of Crimson, a place shrouded in darkness with hidden dangers.

The goal is to **survive and gain Blood Points** over **16 nights or more**. The vampire with the most Blood Points at the end of the ritual will be crowned, unless they are infected by the **Shadow Strain**, a hidden virus that turns vampires into savage creatures driven to bite others.

* Only **one vampire** is infected at a time.
* The infected vampire must spread the strain within **3 rounds**, or they die.
* During **Emergency Meetings**, players vote to stake the suspected vampire. Correct guesses earn points; wrong guesses bring chaos.
